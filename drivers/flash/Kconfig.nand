	  Device driver initialization priority.
	  Device is connected to SPI bus, it has to

	  This is the wait delay (in us) to allow for CS switching to take effect

	help
	  Where supported deep power-down mode can reduce current draw
	  to as little as 0.1% of standby current.  However it takes
	  some milliseconds to enter and exit from this mode.

	  Select this option for applications where device power
	  management is not enabled, the flash remains inactive for
	  long periods, and when used the impact of waiting for mode
	  enter and exit delays is acceptable.

config SPI_NAND_SHELL
	bool "Enable NAND shell"
	depends on SHELL
	default y
	help
	  This shell provides access to basic device data.
