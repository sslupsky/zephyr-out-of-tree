	  When CONFIG_FLASH_PAGE_LAYOUT is used this driver will support
	  that API.  By default the page size corresponds to the block
	  size (262144).  Other options include the 32K-byte erase size
	  (32768), the sector size (4096), or any non-zero multiple of the
	  sector size.

config SPI_NAND_IDLE_IN_DPD
	bool "Use Deep Power-Down mode when flash is not being accessed."
	help
	  Where supported deep power-down mode can reduce current draw
	  to as little as 0.1% of standby current.  However it takes
	  some milliseconds to enter and exit from this mode.

	  Select this option for applications where device power
	  management is not enabled, the flash remains inactive for
	  long periods, and when used the impact of waiting for mode
	  enter and exit delays is acceptable.
