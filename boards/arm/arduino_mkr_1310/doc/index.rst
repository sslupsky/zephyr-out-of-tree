Other hardware features are not currently supported by Zephyr.

The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/arduino_mkr_1310/arduino_mkr_1310_defconfig`.

Connections and IOs
===================

The `Arduino store`_ has detailed information about board
connections. Download the `Arduino MKR WAN 1310 Schematic`_ for more detail.

System Clock
============

The SAMD21 MCU is configured to use the 32.768 kHz external oscillator
with the on-chip PLL generating the 48 MHz system clock.  The internal
APB and GCLK unit are set up similar to the upstream Arduino
libraries.

Serial Port
===========

The SAMD21 MCU has 6 SERCOM based USARTs. SERCOM5 is available on the D13/D14
pins.

SPI Port
========

The SAMD21 MCU has 6 SERCOM based SPIs.

I2C Port
========

The SAMD21 MCU has 6 SERCOM based I2C ports.  On the Arduino MKR WAN 1310, 
SERCOM0 is available on the 6 pin connector at the edge of the board.

USB Device Port
===============

The SAMD21 MCU has a USB device port that can be used to communicate
with a host PC.  See the :ref:`usb-samples` sample applications for
more, such as the :ref:`usb_cdc-acm` sample which sets up a virtual
serial port that echos characters back to the host PC.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Arduino MKR WAN 1310 comes with Atmel SWD.  This provides a debug interface
to the SAMD21 chip and is supported by OpenOCD.

Flashing
========

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :ref:`hello_world` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: arduino_mkr_1310
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. Connect the Arduino MKR WAN 1310 to your host computer using the USB debug
   port.

#. Run your favorite terminal program to listen for output. Under Linux the
   terminal should be :code:`/dev/ttyACM0`. For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -o

   The -o option tells minicom not to send the modem initialization
   string. Connection should be configured as follows:

   - Speed: 115200
   - Data: 8 bits
   - Parity: None
   - Stop bits: 1

#. To flash an image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
      :board: arduino_mkr_1310
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   You should see "Hello World! arm" in your terminal.
